#### Instructions

To keep it simple, we'll follow these conventions.

* `PREFIX` means the default `CTRL-b` here, though I have remapped my `PREFIX` to `CTRL-s` because it's better find it better to reach (also because most of my colleagues already use these key bidings). I hear some people have mapped their `Caps-lock-a` as their `PREFIX`. Use your discretion here. There are no rules. 

* `CTRL-s` means "press the CTRL and s keys simultaneously"

* `CTRL-R` means the same thing, except that you'll need to use
the `SHIFT` key to produce the capital "R". Just notice the capital letters.

* `CTRL-s d` means "press the CTRL and s keys simultaneously, then release,
and then press d"

* `$ tmux new-session` the dollar sign represents the prompt from the shell session.Â·

## Basics

| Abrv   | Full Name     |
| -------|---------------|
| new    | new-session   |
| -s     | session       |
| -t     | target        |
| a / at | attach        |
| ls     | list sessions |
| -h     | horizontal    |
| -v     | vertical      |
| -d     | detach        |

#### Creating Named Sessions

`$ tmux new -s [name_of_session]`

#### Attaching From Sessions
 
 `$ tmux attach -t [name_of_existing_session]`

#### Detaching From Sessions

* `CTRL-s` `d`, or
* `PREFIX` `d`
  * NOTE: *The session you just dettached from, is still running in the background,
meaning you can still re-attach to it later.*

#### Killing Sessions

`$ tmux kill-session -t [name_of_session]`

## Window Management (Tabs)

#### Creating and naming a window with a new session

 `$ tmux new -s [name_of_session] -n [name_of_window]`

  * The `-n` flag tells tmux to name the first window whatever you pass in the `name_of_window`.

#### Creating a window from an existing session

  `PREFIX` `c` 
        
NOTE: You can then rename your newly created window by using *`PREFIX` `,`*
  
#### Tmux Command Line Mode

  `PREFIX` `:`
  
  then in the prompt we should be able to enter
  
  `new-window -n [name_of_window]`
  
   * Except that this is rather verbose and long to create a named window (tab).

#### Switching Windows

`PREFIX` `[1..9]`

#### Displaying a list of windows

`PREFIX` `w`

#### Closing a window with a prompt

`PREFIX` `&`

#### Spliting windows

  * Horizontally (will stack one pane on top of each other)
  
  `PREFIX` `-` (hyphen)
  
  * Vertically (will put one pane next to each other)
  
  `PREFIX` `\`

#### Resizing split windows

 * Smaller steps
 
   `SHIFT-LEFT` `SHIFT-RIGHT` `SHIFT-UP` `SHIFT-DOWN`

 * Bigger steps
 
   `CTRL-LEFT` `CTRL-RIGHT` `CTRL-UP` `CTRL-DOWN`

## Settings

* Reloads .tmux.conf

`PREFIX` `r`

## Creating Custom Scripts

* Based on the knowledge we have above, we can start a script with some tmux commands.
Let's create a file called `~/development`. 
  * `touch ~/development`
  
  In it we start with:
  
  `tmux new-session -s development -n editor -d`
  
  * **Recap**: we're creating a new named session called `development` a new *window* called `editor` and immediatedly detaching from this new session with the `-d` flag.
  
  
  * In Tmux we can send commands to other sessions with `send-keys`. This is going to come handy when running script like the ones we're creating. Here's an example.

  Ex: `tmux send-keys -t development 'cd ~/devproject' C-m` - cd into devproject directory.
  
  Ex: `tmux send-keys -t development 'vim' C-m` - opens vim editor.
  
  **NOTE**: `C-m` is equivalent to pressing `ENTER`. Notice how the commands `cd ~/devproject` and `vim` are in quotes as well.  
  
  Ex: `tmux split-window -v -t development` - splits a window vertically.
  
  Ex: `tmux split-window -v development main-horizontal` - splits the main window horizontally.
  
  * We can target another window as well with this formatting. `[session]:[window].[pane]`.
  
  Ex: `tmux send-keys -t development:1.2 'cd ~/devproject' C-m` cd into devproject directory in sesson 1 window 2.
  
The script looks like something like this, with extra stuff. The sky is the limit here. 

```
tmux new-session -s development -n editor -d
tmux send-keys -t development 'cd ~/devproject' C-m
tmux send-keys -t development 'vim' C-m
tmux split-window -v -t development
tmux select-layout -t development main-horizontal
tmux send-keys -t development:1.2 'cd ~/devproject' C-m
tmux new-window -n console -t development
tmux send-keys -t development:2 'cd ~/devproject' C-m
tmux select-window -t development:1
tmux attach -t development
```
